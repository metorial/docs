<Note>
**What you'll learn:**
- How to install the Metorial Python SDK
- How to make requests to the Metorial API using the SDK

**Before you start:**
- [Create your API Keys](/api-getting-started)

**External resources:**
- [Python SDK on GitHub](https://github.com/metorial/metorial-python)
</Note>

The Metorial Python SDK provides a Pythonic interface for interacting with the Metorial API. Use it to manage deployments, create sessions, handle OAuth flows, and integrate MCP tools into your Python applications.

The SDK is fully typed with type hints for all methods and resources, making it ideal for use with modern Python development tools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Install the SDK using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install metorial
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Using the SDK">
    To use the SDK, import the `Metorial` class and create an instance with your API key:

    ```python
   import asyncio
   from metorial import Metorial
   
   metorial = Metorial(api_key="your-api-key")
    ```

    You can now use the `metorial` instance to make requests to the Metorial API.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Making Requests">
    Create a provider session to interact with your deployed MCP servers. The session automatically formats tools for your chosen provider and handles the connection lifecycle:

    ```python
    async def main():
    async with metorial.provider_session(
        provider="openai",  # Tool format: "openai", "anthropic", "google", etc.
        server_deployments=["your-deployment-id"],
    ) as session:
        # See your available tools
        for tool in session.tools:
            print(f"- {tool['function']['name']}")

        # Call a tool directly
        result = await session.call_tool("search", {"query": "python news"})
        print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Using Types">
    The SDK includes type hints for all API resources. Use tools like mypy or your IDE's type checker to catch errors before runtime and get autocomplete suggestions for all API methods and parameters.
  </Step>
