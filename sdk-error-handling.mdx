The Metorial SDK throws typed errors that help you identify and handle specific failure scenarios. All API-related errors are instances of `MetorialAPIError`, which includes the error message, HTTP status code, and error type.

## Catching Errors

Wrap your Metorial SDK calls in try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully. Check if the error is a `MetorialAPIError` to access structured error information.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { MetorialAPIError } from 'metorial';

try {
    await metorial.withProviderSession(
        provider,
        { serverDeployments: [{ serverDeploymentId: 'dep_123' }] },
        async ({ tools, closeSession }) => {
            // Your logic
            await closeSession();
        }
    );
} catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof MetorialAPIError) {
        console.error(`API Error: ${error.message}`);
    }
}
```

```python Python
from metorial import (
    Metorial,
    AuthenticationError,
    NotFoundError,
    RateLimitError,
    OAuthRequiredError,
)

metorial = Metorial()

try:
    async with metorial.provider_session(
        provider="openai",
        server_deployments=["your-deployment-id"],
    ) as session:
        tools = session.tools
except AuthenticationError:
    # Invalid API key
    print("Check your METORIAL_API_KEY")
except NotFoundError:
    # Deployment doesn't exist or not accessible
    print("Deployment not found - verify your deployment ID")
except OAuthRequiredError:
    # Server requires OAuth but no session was provided
    print("This server requires OAuth - see the OAuth section above")
except RateLimitError:
    # Too many requests
    print("Rate limited - try again later")
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
## Common Errors

Here are the most common error types you'll encounter and how to handle them:

**`AuthenticationError`**: You have provided an invalid Metorial API key.

**`NotFoundError`**: The deployment ID doesn't exist or you don't have access to it. Double-check your deployment ID in the Metorial dashboard.

**`OAuthRequiredError`**: The user's OAuth authorization has expired. Prompt them to re-authorize through the OAuth flow.

**`RateLimitError`**: You're making too many requests. Implement exponential backoff and respect rate limit headers.
